TO SPEED UP THE PROCESS 1ST RUN in the master NODE:
- sudo kubeadm config images pull

TO INIT, RUN  in the master NODE:
- sudo kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=10.201.0.0/16 --apiserver-advertise-address=192.168.63.11
- you will get a kubeadm join command run that in you master node after Install the CNI

TO INSTALL CNI (weave):
- sudo kubectl apply -f https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/releases/download/v2.8.1/weave-daemonset-k8s.yaml

If you face problems while joining a worker node, restart master node and run below commands:
- sudo kubeadm reset
- sudo swapoff -a => all nodes.
- sudo systemctl restart kubelet
- sudo iptables -F
- sudo rm -rf /var/lib/cni/
- sudo systemctl restart containerd
- sudo systemctl daemon-reload

then try again to join... I hope it will work :')
